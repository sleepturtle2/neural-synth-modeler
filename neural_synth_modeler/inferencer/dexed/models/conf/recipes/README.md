# Training options

Training options are divided into three sections:

1. `config.yaml` contains information about a particular set of experiments or a run.
1. The `models` directory stores config files used to build the models tested on the paper,
and the config of the differentiable synthesizers.
1. The `hyperparams` directory contains settings used to train `DDX7` and the `HpN Baseline`.
